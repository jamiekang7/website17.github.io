            Everyone has different thoughts on certain things and those thoughts can drive people to do something they
            regret. Near the end of Lesia’s Dream, Lesia starts to regret the the choice to follow her dreams and come
            to Canada. Lesia’s brother and dad were sent to jail because they were caught sending money to Canada’s main
            enemy in war (Ukraine). Everything turns out horrible and Lesia’s family is barely surviving in the cold
            winter. Lesia expected Canada to be the land of honey and riches, she still believes in that, but Lesia
            thinks that she’s not experienced enough to benefit from it. Lesia soon plans to save up money and go back
            to her native land, which is a quitter move. I would of stayed because the farm is looking great and it’s
            supposed to be hard to farm in winter. Furthermore, the business is only beginning and its equivalent to
            closing up a shop because it isn’t filled with customers in the first two months. Lesia’s family is also
            receiving large amounts of support from Andrew’s family and he is also using his time to help clear the
            acres. If I was Lesia, I would keep the farm until summer and if the business is still undeveloped then I
            would sell it and go back to Shuparka. If I was Lesia I wouldn’t be as upset because a large amount of
            wealthy Ukrainian farmers started off in a similar situation as them. Lesia still has chance to become rich
            and successful, but her feelings might prevent that from happening.
