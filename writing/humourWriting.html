        <p>Imagine the world without humor. Humor connects us and creates a portal to happiness. But jokes need to have
            certain aspects to it; it needs to be relatable, somewhat original, and sometimes offensive. If the main
            focus
            of a joke fulfills all of those key aspects then it makes the joke much more of a “knee slapper”.</p>
        <p>People “feel” a movie scene or a plot in a novel when it’s relatable to them. Jokes have to be relatable for
            the
            receiver to “feel” it and that results in the joke being more amusing. Many accounts in Instagram are made
            to
            share funny posts, which are called memes. An example of a relatable meme is where a caption of a slipper
            with
            knifes sticking out is “What your mom thinks of a slipper”. Another example of a relatable post could be a
            picture of Squid ward frowning and the caption stating that he looks like the viewer of the joke when they
            wake
            up on a Monday. If the person that viewed the first joke (with the slipper) never had their mother toss her
            trusty slipper at them, then the joke may be hard to understand and end up uninteresting. Many jokes are
            hilarious to people when they experienced the joke themselves. In fact, many jokes found on social media
            sites
            are gags that most people can relate to. The saying goes “You’ll laugh at yourself in the future”.</p>




        <p> A known fact is that humans get bored of things easily. Imagine opening the same present every Christmas
            for
            multiple years. That’s not very fun. The same applies for the art of humor. A joke will get old or
            uninteresting
            if it is used many times and the reason for this affect is the surprise factor of a gag. A very shocking
            joke
            would be a meme with a dog looking very worried and a caption that states, “When your owner is getting
            jumped
            and they say ‘Get that dog too’.” The meme of the dog anxiously looking around would be funny because
            most
            people rarely see these types of videos. But lets say you’ve seen the meme with the dog and another
            identical
            meme comes up with the video of the same pet but with a caption that says “When your owner gets attacked
            by
            knights and they say ‘We shall strike that dog too’.” Now that you’ve seen both, the second meme
            wouldn’t be as
            funny as if you’ve seen that one first. Jokes have to be new to catch people’s interest; therefore, if
            the joke
            is old then it will be less amusing. Jokes are like age, the older it gets the less interesting and dull
            it
            becomes. Extending on age, modern jokes that are currently relevant tend to be offensive to those of the
            older
            age groups.
        </p>

        <p>Most people who get offended easily aren’t very fun in parties or in any activity. They also don’t get
            along
            with most jokes because there could be a part where it could offend them. The point of a wisecrack is to
            tear
            the viewer up and jokes usually have to be a bit offensive to make it more diverting. Examples of
            offensive
            jokes could be imitating Donald Trump’s actions. On the Jimmy Fallon show, Jimmy puts on a “Donald
            Trump” like
            wig and he imitates Trump’s hand actions. The audience bursted out laughing and the reaction wouldn’t
            have been
            the same if it didn’t offend Donald in anyway. Meme pages on Instagram don’t leave a smile on everyone’s
            face,
            especially gaming pages. Xbox (a video game console) users are the center of many offensive jokes and
            they are
            equivalent to a rug that enters a shredder then poured into a landfill that is planned to be a nuclear
            bomb test
            field. Xbox users are not the only people getting made fun of, companies are getting mocked too. Almost
            every
            user that follows gaming pages on Instagram knows how EA (a video game company) tries to extract as much
            money
            from their customers as possible. A game from EA is basically uncompleted. EA’s customers have to buy
            tons of
            DLC (Downloadable Content) and many meme accounts take advantage of the company’s acts. One meme from
            Instagram
            shows a picture of a Payment Terminal and the caption adds that it’s EA’s new console. I’m pretty
            confident that
            this doesn’t bring a smile to EA’s face. Jokes have a huge power over the world and many ruined lives
            because of
            sudden popularity to people that don’t want negative feedback from the viewers of their memes.
