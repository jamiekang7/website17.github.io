        <p>“Stefano The Peasant” was Stefano’s nickname since he was three years old. His mom called him “Stefano The
            Peasant” because he would always chew wheat and play with the naughty kids. Stefano became a teacher,
            despite his anger tantrums that happen once in a while. Stefano didn’t need a degree to become a teacher
            because of the lack of educators in his town. The town was small and when confidential information gets
            leaked, they spread like peanut butter on bread. Stefano’s best friend (who was very naughty) accidentally
            blurted out Stefano’s nickname in public, and that’s how the name calling started. One day Stefano couldn't
            take the name calling and flipped out in the middle of his class that he was teaching. “Breaking News! A
            teacher (Stefano) flipped out in the middle of his class and he’s accused of breaking a student’s leg. Stay
            tuned for more information”. Stefano sighed and turned off the television. The student pressed charges on
            Stefano and the only thing he could say in court was “My mom made the nickname! And it's very-very-very
            offensive! You are making fun of my family tree and my peasant tradition every time you say that word! Yeah
            that’s right”! Long story short, Stefano ended up being punished by the judge and he was forced to be a
            non-profit farmer for three months.

        <p>A month had passed and Stefano had become used to the work he was given. He had to cover 3 acres of land
            before his punishment was due and he currently covered two acres with plants. Stefano hired a few workers
            that lived nearby to take care of the animals, while he worked on covering the rest of the farm. Stefano was
            forced to support the farm with his own money and he was practically broke. He had to eat food from his own
            farm and relied on it more than he ever wanted to. Besides that, the farm looked extraordinary and his
            neighbors were very impressed. On the last day of his community service, he covered 4 acres of land and the
            farm was profitable. Stefano was very pleased with the outcome and even shedded a few tears before he got
            escorted back to his hometown.
