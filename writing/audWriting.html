            <p>Aud the Deep Minded was one of the most important women in the viking era for her successful voyage. Aud
                started out as a norwegian female settler in Iceland during the 9th century. She was the daughter of
                Ketill
                Flatnose who was a hersir. A hersir was a title given to a local military chieftain in charge of an army
                that consists of one hundred men in the viking period. Aud’s family was powerful and her father rose to
                the
                throne of the Kingdom of Mann and the isles from c.890 to 900. Aud the Deep Minded wasn’t only a viking
                who
                went on voyages, she was also married. She was married to Olaf the White. Olaf the white was a
                Hiberno-Norse
                King of Dublin in the late 9th century. Aud the Deep Minded had a son with Olaf the White and his name
                was
                Thorstein the Red who became a powerful warrior. Aud’s son conquered most of northern Scotland after his
                father’s death in a battle that took place in Ireland. Thorstein eventually met the same fate as his
                father
                and he was betrayed by his allies, therefore killed in battle. Thorstein’s death is what made Aud embark
                on
                her famous voyage. Aud lived in Caithness at the time of her son’s death. She received a small vessel
                and
                ventured through the North Atlantic Ocean with a crew of twenty men. Aud traveled from the northeast of
                Scotland to the Orkneys. She finally ended her voyage when she reached Breiðafjörður, which is located
                in
                the west of Iceland. </p>
