            Tidings of Comfort and Joy is a very interesting story that takes place in a dystopian society. The main
        character of the story, Hudson Gold is presented as a wealthy man who lives in Caledon Hills, Saskatchewan.
        Although Hudson sounds like an ordinary person at first, he’s not. In fact, he’s very strange to our society
        because he collects Indians. The story starts off in the winter season. Christmas is nearing and Hudson Gold is
        very excited to celebrate the tradition because he loves giving and receiving gifts. But this year Hudson has a
        growing feeling of unease. One day Hudson peered out of his window and saw that one of his native woman he
        collected was pregnant. Then the indians started drumming and singing. Hudson thought this was strange and
        called Vince the next day. Vince also thought it was weird and he said this was a big problem. Then , Vince
        called Frank to come to Hudson’s place. Hudson ate the snacks that Eleanor (Hudson’s wife) made before she left.
        A few minutes later, Vince came with Frank and he brought shotguns. They walked to Hudson’s camp that he made
        for his collection and scouted the Indians. There was a crowd of them and in the middle there was the pregnant
        mother with twin babies. Hudson was very excited because twins were worth more because they’re a collection.
        Frank and Vince acted negatively because they were jealous at Hudson. A few days later Hudson checked his
        collection of Indians, and they were all gone, disappeared. The story ends with Hudson Gold feeling hopeless and
        the tiring fact that he has to restart his whole collection.
