        <p>In the USA, militaries and police departments ban beards. There was also a tax on beards in Russia. But why
            all the hate on beards? One of the main reasons why the United States military doesn’t allow bearded men is
            because it prevents a tight seal for gas masks. The police department prevents their officers from wearing
            beards because it violates their uniform standards, and recently Dallas is the only city that lets their
            officers have beards. Fortunately, there is a solution for people who want to remove facial hair, the answer
            is shaving. Most people shave to just have a cleaner look, not to join the army or the police department,
            but they do not realise how much shaving impacts their daily routine. Do you know that the average man
            subconsciously takes around 150 strokes when they shave their beard. A man’s beard has 10,000 to 15,000 hair
            follicles, which means that one stroke shaves around 83 hair follicles. The general idea of shaving has
            changed enormously since 30,000 BC (around the first time people started shaving), but somehow the routine
            is practically the same. Thousands of years ago both men and women shaved, and that still applies for today.
            Most people shave unless it affects their religion, culture, or they just want a beard. But those who shave,
            shave for a cleaner look on their face. Shaving is usually done in a washroom or an appropriate place such
            as a barber shop. The tools needed to shave are not expensive or complicated. All you need to shave is a
            razor, and shaving cream or gel is optional. The steps to shave are simple, the first step is completely
            optional, which is applying shaving cream or gel. The second step in shaving is just shaving your hair with
            a razor in the direction of the hair. It’s very rare for someone getting shaved by someone else, it is
            usually done manually and is performed by the person that needs the shave. Shaving can be done anytime, just
            try not to do it in a job interview. Although most razors are the same, men usually choose their razors
            based on the feel of it on their skin, not the actual quality. There are many shaving brands, such as
            Gillette and they customize their razors to satisfy the customer the most by feel, not on efficiency, and
            it's amazing how shaving has made its way to many people's’ daily routines, when it once was a rare thing to
            do.</p>
