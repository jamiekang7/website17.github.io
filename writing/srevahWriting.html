        <p>The Srevahs are a very strange tribe, they do daily practices that are strange and unusual, yet they find it
            normal. It is unbearable to even think of their “normal” ritual that they perform on themselves, usually
            daily or weekly. The Srevahs are a global group that consists of a variety of members that believe they are
            the “proper” form of their kind. The Srevahs believe that non members are unkempt or on the lower end of the
            strange hierarchy that their system revolves around. The Srevahs believe that the natural course of growth
            is absurd and that they must eliminate a natural body function. During the rituals of cutting off parts of
            their body, they may or may not soothe their pain with a special cream made by the most important of them
            all, the supplying men. The Srevahs receive their tools from the supplying men to perform their rituals,
            such as a double bladed knife that ensures a higher possibility of the body part cutting off, in exchange
            for their form of currency. Srevahs would throw away their sharp tools for even more pointed appliances that
            cuts their fur easier. The Srevahs’ rituals are short but usually done in a closed room with a reflecting
            surface. The Srevahs usually have a variety of tools, most Srevahs would buy a new tool for every ritual,
            but some stick to one. The ritual that they perform are very self damaging, so some of them put on a magical
            cream that soothes the cuts. Then they get their pointed blade and do a scraping motion on their body. If
            the ritual is not done properly then it may result in blood loss or irresistible itching. From the data that
            is collected, the ritual is usually done on the face of the Srevahs and the scraping motion is following the
            pattern of the thin yarn that is embroidered in their faces. It is rarely seen for Srevahs to help each
            other perform the ritual, it is probably an individual act. But we are left scratching our heads because
            there are few incidences where the Srevahs perform the ritual to one another in a particular area that has
            multiple reflecting surfaces. Furthermore, the Srevahs that do the ritual on the others are usually the same
            Srevahs, it’s almost as if they live in the area where they perform the ritual on other members. Even though
            the ritual is violent and harmful, the Srevahs find it totally normal that they do it anytime and usually
            anywhere if they needed to. The Srevahs are a tribe that was created many years ago, but long ago there were
            only a few members, but now it spread like a plague, and it’s main reason for the sudden boom of members was
            unexpected, because the reason for the sudden increase was because of the stigmas associated with the non
            members that the Srevahs created themselves. </p>
