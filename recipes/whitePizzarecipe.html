            <li>1 14-16" pizza dough</li>

        <h2>About This Dish</h2>
        <p>Summer calls for a lighter, fresher, more vibrant pizza. Earlier this week I splurged on some fresh
            mozzarella
            for my Kale Pesto Pasta and I wanted to make sure the rest of that delicious cheese didn’t go to waste. My
            first
            thought was Margherita pizza, but then I decided to do a little something different. Instead of topping this
            simple white pizza with thin ribbons of fresh basil, I made a small batch of zesty parsley pesto and
            drizzled it
            over top after cooking.</p>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a very small bowl or dish, stir together 1 Tbsp olive oil and the garlic powder. Let the mixture sit
                and
                infuse while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>To make the parsley pesto, finely mince 1 packed cup of fresh parsley leaves (about 1/2 cup once
                minced).
                Add the minced garlic, grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Add the lemon juice and
                olive
                oil to the mixture, starting with just 1 Tbsp lemon juice and 2 Tbsp olive oil, and adding more if
                needed to
                create a mixture that is loose enough to drizzle over the pizza. I used 1.5 Tbsp lemon and 3 Tbsp oil
                total,
                but this will depend on the volume of your minced parsley. Set the parsley pesto aside.</li>
            <li>Move your oven's rack to the top position and begin preheating the oven to 500ºF. Thinly slice the
                tomatoes
                and fresh mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Stretch or roll your pizza dough out to a 14-16" disc. Place it on a pizza pan or baking sheet*. Stir
                the
                garlic and oil, then brush a thin later over the entire surface of the dough, including the outer crust.
            </li>
            <li>Arrange the tomato slices evenly over the pizza dough, then top with torn slices of mozzarella. </li>
            <li>Bake the pizza in the fully preheated 500ºF oven for 10 minutes, or just until the outer crust is golden
                brown and the cheese is melted, but not browned. After removing the pizza from the oven, drizzle the
                parsley
                pesto over top, slice into eight pieces, and serve.</li>
            </li>
