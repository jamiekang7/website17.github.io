            <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
            <p>Each if statement uses a logical operator to decide if something is true or false. The result determines whether to run the block of code or skip it</p>
            <p>This is a list of the most common logical operators</p>
            <img src="../images/listofmostcommonlogicaloperators.png">
            <p>Boolean values are either true or false and can be combined with an if statement to determine if a code should be run or skipped</p>
            <br>
            <h2>If Statements</h2>
            <p>The most straight forward conditional statement is the if statement. An if statement basically says "if this condition is true, then run this block of code." If the condition isn't true, the program will skip the block of code.</p>
            <p>In most cases, you'll use a if statement to check simple conditions with only a few possible outcomes</p>
            <img src="../images/lettemperatureover100example.png">
            <p>The outcome would be...</p>
            <img src="../images/thewaterisboilingexample.png">
            <p>Because the temperature is 100 and the if statement says that if the temperature is 100 or over, then it would print "The water is boiling."</p>
            <br>
            <h2>If-Else Statements</h2>
            <p>An if statement will run a block of code if the condition is true, but if the condition is not true you can add an else clause to an if statement, so you can specify a block of code to execute if the condition is not true</p>
            <img src="../images/ifelsethewaterisboiling.png">
            <p>You can use any else if statements to account for any number of potential cases</p>
            <img src="../images/manyelseifstatements.png">
            <br>
            <h2>Boolean Values</h2>
            <p>You can assign the results of a logical operator to a Bool constant or variable in order to check or access the value later. Bool values can only be true or false</p>
            <p>In the following code, the Bool statement determines that the number doesn't qualify as "issmallnumber":</p>
            <img src="../images/issmallnumberbool.png">
            <p>And here, the bool statment determines that "currentSpeed" does qualify as "isSpeeding" </p>
            <img src="../images/isspeedingistrueexample.png">
            <p>It's also possible to invert a Bool value using the logical NOT operator which is represented with !</p>
            <img src="../images/varsissnowingfalse.png">
            <p>Console output:</p>
            <img src="../images/itisnotsnowingexample.png">
            <p>You can use logical AND operator, represented by &&, to check if 2 or more conditions are true</p>
            <img src="../images/andandoperatorexample.png">
            <p>The console will output:</p>
            <img src="../images/thetemperatureisjustright.png">
            <p>The logical OR operator, represented by ||, to check if either one of two condtitions is true</p>
            <img src="../images/ifpluggedinorhasbatterypower.png">
            <p>This will result in saying "You can use your laptop." because it has battery power, and only one of the two need to be true</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Switch Statement</h2>
            <p>Since a long chain of if-else statemnts may get messy and hard to read, so to make matters more efficient Swift has a control flow called a switch statement</p>
            <p>A basic switch statement takes a value with multiple options and allows you to run seperate code based on each option, or case. You can also provide a default case to specify a block of code that will run in all the cases you haven't specifically defined.</p>
            <img src= "../images/letnumberofwheelsswitchstatement.png">
            <p>This code provides a seperate action if the value is 1,2,3 or 4. It also provides an action if numberOfWheels is anything else.</p>
            <p>If this was written as an if-else statement, it would become diffcult to understand</p>
            <br>
            <p>A case statement can also evaluate multiple conditions at once:</p>
            <img src= "../images/casestatementevaluatemultiplecasestatementatonce.png">
            <p>When working with numbers you can use interval matching to check for inclusion in a range </p>
            <img src="../images/caseintervalmatching.png">
            <p>The switch operator is the right tool for control flow when you want to run different code based on many different conditions</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Ternary Operator</h2>
            <p>An interesting (and very common) use case for an if statement is to set a variable or return a value. If a certain condition is true, you want to set a variable to one value. If the condition is false, you want to set the variable to a different value.</p>
            <p>The following block of code checks if the value of one number is greater than the other and assigns the higher value to a largest variable</p>
            <img src="../images/variablelargestinteger.png">
            <p>Because this situation is so common in programming, many languages include a special operator, called a ternary operator (?:), for writing more concise code</p>
            <img src="../images/the ternary operator has 3 parts.png">
            <br>
            <img src="../images/ternaryoperatorexample.png">
            <p>Translation: If "a" is greater than "b", assign "a" to the largest constant, otherwise assign "b".</p>
            <p>In this case "a" is greater than "b", so it's assigned to largest.</p>
            <p>You are not required to use this, but it is more efficient than performing a more complex if-else statement.</p>
