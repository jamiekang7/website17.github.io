            <p>In Swift you can check to see if a object has a certain type, you can check by using "is"</p>

            <h2>Type Casting</h2>
            <p>You can use the as? operator to try and downcast the value to a more specific type and store it in a new constant. You'll use an if-let syntax to check the conditions before converting the type. This method is better to use when the object created is used in the curly braces</p>

            <p>Any can represent an instance of any type</p>

            <p>As seen above, many different types were put into this array, this is because the array is of type [Any]</p>
