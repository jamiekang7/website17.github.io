            <h2>Constants</h2>
            <p>When you want to name a value that won't change during the lifetime of the program, you'll use a constant</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You define constants in Swift using the let keyword</li>
            </ul>
            <img src = "../images/letconstantjohnexample.png">
            <p>The code above creates a constant named "name" and it assigns the value "John" to the constant</p>
            <p>If you want to access that value in later lines of code, you can use "name" to reference the constant directly </p>
            <img src = "../images/letconstantjohnprintcodeexmaple.png">
            <p>YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE VALUE LATER ON</p>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>When you want to name a value that might change during the lifetime of the app, you'll use a variable</p>
            <p>You define variables using the "var" keyword</p>
            <img src = "../images/varAge29Example.png">
            <p>This would print 29 to the console</p>
            <img src = "../images/ageisvariablechange.png">
            <p>Since this is a variable this code will print 30 to the console</p>
            <p>You can use constant or varible names to to assign other variables and constants</p>

            <h2>Naming Constants and Varibles Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Names can't contain mathematical symbols</li>
                <li>Names can't contain spaces</li>
                <li>Names can't begin with number</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Types</h2>
            <p>A property represents information of an object, and a function performs some sort of action with the object</p>
            <img src = "../images/structurepersonexample23.png">
            <p>By reading this there are 2 string values, (firstName, lastName) these are properties which store information about the person</p>
            <p>sayHello() is a function and it defines an action for the person</p>
